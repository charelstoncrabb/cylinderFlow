//! Abstract base solver class
/*!
This abstract base class provides a minimal public API for computing a finite element solution on the provided FEMesh. The intent here is to provide a flexible architecture to allow for easy future incorporation of different finite element models.
\todo Still need to design & implement boudary condition UI; a need for flexibility in the types of boundary conditions means it should be done within the Solver classes, though there is a strong dependency on the finite element mesh/basis used.
