C++ Finite Element C\+FD for Planar Flow

See Documentation\textbackslash{}manual.\+pdf for more detailed explanations, or browse the source code documentation \href{https://charelstoncrabb.github.io/cylinderFlow/html/index.html}{\tt here}.

The H\+E\+AD revision should build on both Mac and Windows machines, and a basic makefile is included for convenience; please feel free to contact me with questions, comments, issues, suggestions, etc.

Note\+: the python scripts assume the python interpreter lives in \textquotesingle{}usr/bin/python\textquotesingle{}. If this is different on your machine, this will need to be changed.

Architechture\+: \begin{quote}
Classes\+: \end{quote}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_options}{Options}}\+: handles input/command line options for meshing
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_node}{Node}}\+: graph node object for use in meshing
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_facet}{Facet}}\+: class the represents the triangles produced in the mesh
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_mesh}{Mesh}}\+: class that parses input node data and produces Delaunay Traingulation of nodes using divide and conquer algorithm
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{class_matrix}{Matrix}}\+: class that has overloaded std\+::vector$<$double$>$ to allow for matrix operations, including but not limited to arithmetic, computing characteristic polynomials, and a QR eigenvalue solver/singular values solver
\item T\+O\+DO\+: Solver\+: class that uses meshed grid to solve equations (want to keep this as general as possible, to hopefully be able to use the software for many different models)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{quote}
Python pre/post-\/processing\+: \end{quote}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Mesh\+Plot.\+py\+: creates 2D plot of output graph written by \mbox{\hyperlink{class_mesh}{Mesh()}} class
\item square\+Grid.\+py\+: creates a square grid input file of specified size
\item rand\+Grid.\+py\+: creates a randomized grid of specified size
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{cfgui_8py}{cfgui.\+py}}\+: provides a G\+UI to produce small meshes (more detailed and robust graphical user interface is planned)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{quote}
Using\+: \end{quote}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Example input files are included for format demonstration
\item Both code and processors support \textquotesingle{}-\/h\textquotesingle{} flag for syntax help
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{quote}
Planned Features\+: \end{quote}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Input-\/specified grid constraints (e.\+g., flow around a cylinder)
\item A more robust mesh editing G\+UI; current approach with Tk in python with matplotlib is not very scalabe.
\item Incorporate solution visualization into G\+UI 
\end{DoxyItemize}
